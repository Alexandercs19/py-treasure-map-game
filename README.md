## 🎯 Project Overview

**Treasure Island** is a terminal-based adventure game where the player must make a series of choices to find hidden treasure.  
Some decisions unlock new paths, while others lead to failure — encouraging logical thinking and careful reading.

This project focuses on **program flow and decision-making**, not graphics or external libraries.
